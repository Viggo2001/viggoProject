 	<p>I grew up wih no exposure to Software Development for numerous years. I never knew it took a skill to make a Website or an App. Due to my lack of undersanding in technology, I was under the impression that one just needs a certain platform to where they can jus choose a color for background, drag a picure or video from the Photo lab, draw lines etc. I never knew it took special types of tags to actually draw and insert these things.</p>
 	<p>When my brother and my bestfriend did I.T at school, I was doing grade 11. My brother showed us a website he did for school. I never really knew what's really challenging until he showed me the coding he did for that website to do what it does and look that way. I was completely astonished. My bestfriend showed me what they did in Delphi. I started downloading HTML tutorials from YouTube. I learned a lot from CSS as well. I had an app called "Dcoder" where you can do your projects. I made a web page on my cellphone, I didn' have a laptop. I still don't.</p>
 	<p>As time wen by, doing my matric, I tried back-end coding. I didn't want any other language but Python because of what I heard about it. I never knew about any other programming lanuage either than Java, C, C++, PHP, Python, C# and Javascript. Either way I chose Python for a reason, I heard it's good for Robotics, Web Development and App Development. It's very diverse. Robotics are also my area of interest. Under normal circumstances I should learn JavaScript after HTML and CSS. I chose Python. I heard it lacked in Framework but later found out that Django and Flask and many more came to the rescue. So I had to pick a Framework.</p>
 	<p>I have no deep understanding of Python because I was busy with my Matric at the time I wanted to learn the language. I had only covered variables, working with numbers and if statements. This year i'm looking to Develop in Python although this project is made from Javascript. I forced myself into learning the language.</p>
