    <div class="aCode">
  <p>Here are things that I usually do during the day.</p>
	 <h2>Code</h2>
	  <img src="" width="200">
       <p>I have an app called 'Dcoder' where I can code on my cellphone but it's not as fun as coding in a Personal Computer.</p>
     <h2>Draw</h2>
     <div>
      <img src="Eden_Hazard.jpg" alt="Eden_Hazard"width="600" border="8">
       <p>I drew this picture for a school poster but it was a rough sketch. The final piece was the one I submitted.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
      <img src="J_Cole.jpg" width="600" border="8">
       <p>I fell in love with the song Pretty Little Fears by J Cole and 6lack so when I was bored, I drew this.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
      <img src="Living_room.jpg" width="600" border="8">
      <p>Running out of ideas on what to draw, I decided to look around me and drew whatever I saw.</p>
     </div>
       <p>I still have a few Comic strips in my room from a long time.</p>
     <h2>Rap</h2>
      <p>I've been a rapper for 2 years but I've been featured. I haven't been really dropping my own music. I'm not as serious as I used to but everyone in the wholw of Ilitha park knows how dangerous it is to feature me.</p>
       <video src=""></video>
     <h2>Read</h2>
       <p>I don't read a lot of Novels. I read books on how wealth is built for example books from Robert Kiyosaki (Rich Dad Poor Dad, Fake) and others like The Richest Man in Babylon etc. I stopped reading Novels 2 years ago.</p>
     <h2>Exercise</h2>
       <p>I always take time to exercise even during exams just to ease the stress and relax my body. I also do it so I can engage with the outside world since I'm always at home.</p>
