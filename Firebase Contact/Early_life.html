     <h2>Residence</h2>

      <p>I grew up in a middle-class household in Ilitha park. Actually when I was born my family resided at Mandalay. Then we moved to Khayelisha, H-Section. My Mother went to work in England and I was left with my father and 3 brothers in 2006. At that time, I was 5 years old and my father was a caretaker at a matric-upgrading school at Langa. He didn't earn much but my mother kept our residence alive as she was a Manager at a Library. I still don't know which position she held or which organisation she worked for in England though. I never asked</p>

      <p>My mother returned from England months later and we moved to our Grandfather's house in Makhaya while building a house in Ilitha Park. We lived in Makhaya for 2 years and moved to our new home. I was 7 years old a that time and I was doingn my first grade. I used to draw a lot because I've always enjoyed creativity. I watched a lo of cartoons and tried to draw them too. My second oldes brother was and still is good at drawing and he does Animation. So he would be an inspiration. I continued drawing and became better and better.</p>

      <h2>Primary Life</h2>
      <hr>
    <div class="terror">
      <p>At 5th grade, I was bullied at school more than anyone. People took advantage of my good behaviour that I received an award for countless times. I was called names, emotionally bullied for how I wore, acted and lack of slang vocabulary. I hated school so much but knew that I didn't have a choice. I had a few friends who were just like me. Most people would come to us just laugh at us for being so-called "dorks" in American slang. So when it was time for me to go to high school, I told myself things will change. I'll be a different person.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>At high school, I started smoking, drinking and partying. I used to love weed. I was a very bright, lazy person. Weed made me lazier. I would get A's for Mathematics. I believe that trait was from my father's side but he had to quit school for other reasons. My Mother never liked Mathematics. I carried on with substance abuse. I knew I had to stop eventually so I pulled a "slowly-but-surely" move. Then I completely stopped weed. Early grade 10 I decided to stop alcohol too. When I had made my choice of subjects and Maths and Physics was not one of them. I totalled some tests in Maths literacy with no effort because I was meant to do Mathematics. I downloaded a Pure Maths textbook and tutorials of each topic. That's when I knew I have to find a way to replace my Maths literacy with Mathematics.</p>

     <h2>The tragedy</h2>
    
      <p>Prior to my Grade 10 June Exams, Mom and Dad's Wedding Anniversary and Dad's birthday, my father fell sick. After a meeting with a Youth Organisation I was part of, I returned home to check if my father has returned from the hospital because he had been admitted the night before. I saw lots of cars on the yard and a very tense mood in a very depressing weather. My Aunty approached me as I entered the door and took me to the room to tell me the bad news. I had never been so angry. I hated myself, I wanted to be someone else. I valued my loved ones so much. But then that was the end.</p>
     <h2>My Decision</h2>
      <p>When I was in grade 11 I decided that I want to become a Software Developer. So I figured I could do I.T in CPUT for that. Then as time went by I developed an interest in Robotics and the Math behind coding. So I wanted to replace my Maths lit with Mathemtics so I can study Computer Science.  I became interested in advanced technology. I was fascinated by AI/Machine Learning. After High school there was no space to study ICT in CPUT. I was accepted for Law at the UWC but I turned down the offer because I don't see myself in that field. I applied because my Mother told me to.</p>
